The son of former City player Alfie, Haaland junior is widely regarded as one of Europe’s best strikers and arrived at the club with a formidable goalscoring reputation following impressive spells at Molde FK, Red Bull Salzburg and Dortmund.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Strong, tall, quick, good in the air and capable of scoring a variety of goals off either foot, Haaland’s career so far has been characterised by one thing: goals. In his debut campaign at City, the Norwegian netted 36 times in the Premier League – breaking the record for the most goals scored in a 38-game season. He also became just the third player in history – and the first for nine years – to score five goals in a single UEFA Champions League game as City beat RB Leipzig 7-0 at the Etihad Stadium.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Haaland hit his 45th goal of the season during the UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg victory over Bayern Munich – meaning he surpassed Ruud van Nistelrooy and Mohamed Salah as the men to have scored most goals for a Premier League club across all competitions in a single campaign.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>He finished his incredible debut season with 52 goals in 53 games and had a fairytale ending as he was part of the Pep Guardiola’s Treble-winning team, which saw them lift the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&lt;b>About Manchester City Football Club:&lt;/b>&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Manchester City FC is an English Premier League club initially founded in 1880 as St Mark’s West Gorton. It officially became Manchester City FC in 1894 and has since then gone onto win the UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners’ Cup, nine League Championship titles, seven FA Cups and eight League Cups. Manchester City FC is one of 13 clubs comprising the City Football Group.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Under manager Pep Guardiola, one of the most highly-decorated managers in world football, the Club plays its domestic and UEFA Champions League home fixtures at the Etihad Stadium, a spectacular 53,500 seat arena that City have called home since 2003. Today, the stadium sits on the wider Etihad Campus, which also encompasses the City Football Academy, a state-of-the-art performance training and youth development facility located in the heart of East Manchester. Featuring a 7,000 capacity Academy Stadium, the City Football Academy is also where Manchester City Women’s Football Club and the Elite Development Squad train on a daily basis and play their competitive home games.&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>For more information, please visit &lt;a href=\&#34;http://www.mancity.com/\&#34;>www.mancity.com&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Contact&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Brando Brandstaeter&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Head of Global Brand Management &amp;amp; Communication&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Midea Group’s International Business Division&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&lt;a href=\&#34;mailto:Brando.Brandstaeter@Midea.com\&#34; target=\&#34;_blank\&#34;>Brando.Brandstaeter@Midea.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Melissa Fenlon&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>Head of Marketing Communications&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>City Football Group&lt;/p>\r\n&lt;p>&lt;a href=\&#34;mailto:melissa.fenlon@cityfootball.com\&#34; target=\&#34;_blank\&#34;>melissa.fenlon@cityfootball.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>\r\n&#34;}}"
